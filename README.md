## Description
In this project we will predict which users will unsubscribe from a fictional Music Streaming App called Sparkify, based on their activity logs. 
The project is implemented with PySpark. PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, a framework made to process and work with huge datasets. The modelling will be done with different machine learning models e.g. linear regression.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

 - pyspark
 - pandas

### Installing:
Clone this GIT repository:

    git clone https://github.com/esther-neumann/sparkify.git

## File Description
The dataset utilized for this study is a big data obtained and provided by Udacity, and thus not publicly available. The dataset is a .json file with record of events of all users on the sparkify streaming platform. For this notebook only the small version of the Dataset was used. 

-- The 'Sparkify.ipynb' file is the notebook used in cleaning, preprocessing, and modelling
